## Digicalc 
Kryptic is a four function binary, octal, hexadecimal calculator. The idea for this app came while furthering 
my studies in computer architecture. *This app make zero use the Java BigInteger class.* 

### Testing
It was tested using two independent sources for solutions. Wolfram Alpha and the Java 
BigInteger class. I automated the testing process by creating a series of test functions. 
Addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division were tested with two full 64bit values, 64bit value 
with a smaller bit size value of random sized, two random smaller bit sized values,
and a 64 bit value with the smallest possible meaningful bit value --> `10`. 
With each test I swapped the values to trying get it to malfunction. It performed as 
expected and, did so quickly. :muscle:

### Published
This application has been published on Google Play and has received a positive rating with a 
feature suggestion. (I plan to include it.)
 
### Possible Erroneous Output
It is very possible that there might be a pair of values, somewhere along the way, that 
will give someone erroneous results. If this happens to you I would be very interested in hearing 
from you.
