DigiCalc

A four function binary, octal, hexadecimal calculator. Idea for this app came while furthering my study of computer architecture. This app does not use the Java BigInteger class.

Its nearly finished. Currently in testing. It is being tested using two independent sources. Wolfram Alpha and the Java BigInteger class. 

Addition/subtraction, multiplication, is being test with two full 64bit values. 64bit value and a smaller bit size value. Two random sized smaller bit sized values. 

It will be piblished when I am satisified it is performing what ever calculation I can throw at it correctly. I am taking it under consideration that there might be a pair of values that it will give erroneous results on.
