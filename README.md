DigiCalc

A four function binary, octal, hexadecimal calculator. The idea for this app came while furthering my study of computer architecture. This app does not use the Java BigInteger class.

Currently in testing. It is being tested using two independent sources for solutions. Wolfram Alpha and the Java BigInteger class. I have automated the testing process by creating a series of test functions. Addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division is being test with two full 64bit values. A 64bit value and a smaller bit size value. Two random smaller bit sized values. With each test I am swapping the value to try and get it to malfunction. So far so good.

It will be published when I am satisified it is performing what ever calculation I can throw at it correctly. I am considerating that there might be a pair of values, somewhere along the way, that will give erroneous results on.
